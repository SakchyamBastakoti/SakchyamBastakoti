Techinnovation4u - Embedded Systems Enthusiast
About Me
Hello, I'm Sakchyam Bastakoti, the founder of Techinnovation4u. I am an electro hobbyist with a deep passion for coding and programming. My journey into the world of electronics began at the age of 9 when I dismantled a CRT TV, sparking my curiosity and setting me on a path of exploration and learning.

Specialization
I specialize in Embedded Systems, focusing on microcontrollers such as Arduino, single-board computers like Raspberry Pi, and IoT boards including ESP8266, ESP32, and NodeMCU. My programming skills in languages like Python allow me to breathe life into these devices, enabling them to perform tasks that traditional electronics cannot.

Why Embedded Systems?
Embedded Systems captivated me by providing the ability to add intelligence to electronic projects. Microcontrollers became the brain of my creations, allowing me to achieve functionalities that were beyond the scope of discrete electronics. Communicating with these microcontrollers using languages like C++ and Python has become second nature to me.

Professional Aspirations
My journey in electronics and coding has led me to make Embedded Systems my professional career choice. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with embedded technologies and contributing to the ever-evolving field.
